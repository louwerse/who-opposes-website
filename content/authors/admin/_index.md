I am an Associate Professor in Political Science at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/tom-louwerse), the Netherlands. My [research](#projects) and [teaching](#teaching) focuses on elections, political representation and parliamentary politics in the Netherlands and other established democracies. 

Currently, I am working on two major research projects. [The Nature of Political Representation in Times of Dealignment](project/napre), supported by the Open Research Area, studies the quality and nature of political representation. The project [Who opposes?](project/who-opposes) focuses on government-opposition cooperation in parliament and is supported by a Vidi grant from the Dutch Research Council (NWO).

My outreach activities include the poll aggregation projects [Peilingwijzer](http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl) in the Netherlands and the [Irish Polling Indicator](https://www.pollingindicator.com). I am a member of of [Young Academy Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/yal).
