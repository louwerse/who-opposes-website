On 22 September project team member Rick van Well joined the Dutch radio programme 'De Nacht van NTR' (The Night of NTR) to talk about parliamentary debates on the Dutch government's budget proposals, government-opposition relations in general, and about his research project on [explanations of government-opposition distinctiveness](https://who-opposes.netlify.app/project/explanations/). 

You can listen to a recording of the broadcast [here](https://www.nporadio1.nl/fragmenten/de-nacht-van/c5094b79-cac9-4bff-a7df-af3eea913b2a/2022-09-22-kennen-oppositiepartijen-hun-plek-nog-wel).
