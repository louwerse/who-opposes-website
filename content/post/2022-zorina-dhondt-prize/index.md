Elina Zorina has won the Victor D'Hondt Prize for the best paper presented by a PhD candidate during the Leuven-Montr√©al Winter School on Elections. The Prize was awarded to two students this year, both to Elina Zorina (Leiden University) and Gefjon Off (University of Gothenburg). At the PhD winter school Elina presented her pre-analysis plan for studying the impact of government-opposition distinctiveness in parliament on voting behaviour.
