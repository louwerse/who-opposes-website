[Rick van Well](https://who-opposes.netlify.app/author/rick-van-well/) was invited to talk about opposition-coalition dynamics in the Dutch parliament in the Dutch podcast 'Het Spel en de Macht' (The Game and the Power). This podcast series about Dutch politics is released by the Centrum voor Nederlandse Politiek en Bestuur (Centre for Dutch Politics and Governance) from Leiden University and the Montesquieu Institute at The Hague, the Netherlands. 

This episode covers the role of the opposition in the Dutch political culture. [Linda Bos](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/b/o/l.bos/l.bos.html), communication scientist from the University of Amsterdam, also joined the podcast to discuss how (populist) parties use the media.
